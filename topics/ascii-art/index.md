I want to share my deep love for ASCII art and how it has become an integral part of my life. From using ASCII art on t-shirts to incorporating it as code-centric schemas, ASCII art has captured my imagination and creativity. In this post, I'll explore its versatility, simplicity, and the joy it brings to my passion for minimalism. Get ready for a journey into the world of ASCII art, filled with enthusiasm and examples of my personal creations.

## Embracing ASCII Art in Real Life

ASCII art has become more than just a digital form of expression for me; it has transcended into real life. I love incorporating ASCII art into various aspects of my life, including t-shirts and merchandise. There's something special about wearing a piece of art that speaks to my passion for creativity. It's a way to showcase my love for ASCII art and share it with the world.

## Code-Centric Schemas: ASCII Art in the Code

One of the aspects I adore about ASCII art is its ability to bring a code-centric approach to visual representation. I often use ASCII art as comments directly in my code to create schemas and diagrams. It allows me to maintain a code-centric philosophy, which is something I deeply appreciate about programming in languages like Go. Comments in Go have a purpose beyond just being annotations; they play a role in tooling and documentation. ASCII art as code-centric schemas helps me convey complex ideas in a visually appealing and code-centric manner.

## The Ease of Embedding ASCII Art

One of the remarkable aspects of ASCII art is its ease of embedding in various formats. Whether it's Markdown, HTML, or even SVG, ASCII art finds its place effortlessly. In Markdown, I can simply enclose the ASCII art within backticks, and it becomes an integral part of my text. HTML's `<pre>` tag provides a perfect container for preserving the original formatting of ASCII art. And with the rise of SVG, ASCII art can be converted into scalable vector graphics, allowing for even more creative possibilities.

## The Charm of Old-School ASCII Art

While I appreciate the new possibilities that Unicode-based ASCII art brings, my heart belongs to the old-school ASCII art created with a limited set of characters. There's a certain charm in the simplicity and universality of these creations. They evoke nostalgia and remind us of the early days of computing when creativity flourished within the constraints of limited character sets. Old-school ASCII art enforces minimalism in a mentally challenging way, pushing us to create meaningful representations with just a few characters.

## Showcasing Personal Creations

As a passionate lover of ASCII art, I've created numerous personal pieces that I'm excited to share with you. From intricate designs to whimsical characters, I've explored the possibilities of ASCII art in both visual and code-based contexts. In this blog post, you'll find examples of my personal creations, including photos and snippets, to give you a glimpse into the world of ASCII art through my eyes.

## Projects and Wishlist

In addition to my personal creations, I've also embarked on various projects related to ASCII art. These projects aim to explore the boundaries of ASCII art and push its creative potential. However, my ultimate goal, which I call my wishlist, is to develop a way to marshal ASCII art, allowing for seamless
