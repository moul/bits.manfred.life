## Introduction

In the ongoing pursuit of a better world, I've come to recognize that the concept of "equality" often entails more complexities than meets the eye. As Albert Einstein aptly stated:

> "Perfection of means and confusion of ends seem to characterize our age."

## Rethinking Perfection

My definition of "perfection" goes beyond managing intricate tasks. It's rooted in establishing fairness and efficiency without succumbing to exhaustion. Imagine navigating a labyrinth, seeking the most efficient path without losing our way or becoming overwhelmed by the journey.

## A New Focus: Embracing Practicality and Reason

While the quest for perfect equality is admirable, I've discovered that it can sometimes lead us down a convoluted path. Rather than aiming for an elusive equilibrium that may never materialize, I've embraced a new focus – one that centers around practicality and reason.

Consider this: Complexity often masks itself as sophistication, but true sophistication lies in simplicity. Striving for perfect equality in every endeavor can lead to unnecessary intricacies that drain our resources, both in terms of time and energy. The pursuit of an unreachable utopia of equal outcomes can inadvertently divert us from the more pressing need for real-world solutions.

This shift towards practicality and reason doesn't mean forsaking the ideals of fairness and progress. Instead, it involves a strategic evaluation of what constitutes true progress. It's about allocating our efforts wisely, channeling our energy into areas where it can make the most significant impact. The notion of a harmonious world becomes less about a stringent balance of every factor and more about recognizing that progress can manifest in varied forms.

## Embracing Imperfections

This pursuit involves embracing the best form of "imperfection." Recognizing that progress doesn't necessarily equate to unwavering equality, it's about discovering a rhythm that serves us well. As we journey forward, each step takes us closer to a world that is more balanced and judicious – a world uncomplicated by unnecessary intricacies.

Sometimes, I imagine going into the future for 10 years and compare how much I would be happy if:

1. I continue pushing for equality.
2. I just consider that it was fair enough and push forward.

I usually imagine being more than satisfied by choosing simple fairness. Interestingly, I also imagine providing actually more than equality, like a win-win or 1+1=3. This is because the time I kept by choosing fairness allowed me to create more collaboration with other actors, which at the end provides more value for everyone.
