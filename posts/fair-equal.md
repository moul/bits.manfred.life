## Introduction

In the ongoing pursuit of a better world, I've come to recognize that the concept of "equality" often entails more complexities than meets the eye. As Albert Einstein aptly stated:

> "Perfection of means and confusion of ends seem to characterize our age."

## Rethinking Perfection

My definition of "perfection" goes beyond merely managing intricate tasks. It's rooted in establishing fairness and efficiency without succumbing to exhaustion. Imagine navigating a labyrinth, seeking the most efficient path without losing our way or becoming overwhelmed by the journey.

## A New Focus

I've shifted from fixating solely on attaining a flawless equilibrium. Instead, I'm embracing equilibrium through practicality and reason. As Steve Jobs wisely pointed out:

> "Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple."

## Embracing Imperfections

This pursuit involves embracing the best form of "imperfection." Recognizing that progress doesn't necessarily equate to unwavering equality, it's about discovering a rhythm that serves us well. As we journey forward, each step takes us closer to a world that is more balanced and judicious – a world uncomplicated by unnecessary intricacies.
