**Status: Draft**

In my quest for a better world, I've realized that aiming for "equality" can
sometimes feel like trying to organize a group of squirrels into a synchronized
dance troupe. As Albert Einstein once wisely put it:

> "Perfection of means and confusion of ends seem to characterize our age."

Now, my idea of "perfect" isn't about herding squirrels – it's about making
things fair and efficient while saving our energy. In the words of Mahatma
Gandhi:

> "The future depends on what you do today."

It's like finding the shortest path through a maze without getting lost and
exhausted.

So, rather than playing squirrel choreographer, I'm using those same
attention-to-detail skills in a new direction. Instead of chasing an elusive
perfect balance, I'm on a mission to create a sense of harmony by embracing
what's reasonable and practical. To quote Steve Jobs:

> "Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking
> clean to make it simple."

My new perfectionism is all about chasing the best version of "imperfect." As
the Bible reminds us in Ecclesiastes 7:20:

> "There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins."

It's about understanding that progress isn't always about strict equality, but
more about finding a rhythm that works. It's a journey where every step forward
takes us closer to a more balanced and sensible world – minus the squirrels, of
course!
