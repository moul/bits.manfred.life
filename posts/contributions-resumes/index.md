## The Compatibility Conundrum

When it comes to meeting candidates for hiring, consulting, or collaboration, relying solely on a resume can be limiting. In this blog post, we'll explore the significance of contributions and how they can serve as a more reliable indicator of compatibility.

### The Risk of No Fit

Candidates who come with a CV but no tangible contributions may pose a higher risk of not being a good fit. Without any demonstrated work or involvement, it becomes challenging to assess their compatibility with the project or organization.

It's not enough to have a well-crafted resume; candidates need to show their ability to contribute and make a meaningful impact.

### The Pitfall of Company Expertise

Candidates who have spent a significant amount of time in a single company may be highly specialized in that specific environment. While this may seem impressive, it can also indicate a lack of versatility and adaptability. It's important to consider candidates who have experience beyond a single company to ensure they can thrive in different environments.

### The Fear Factor

Candidates who have stayed in one company for an extended period may be hesitant to take risks or explore new opportunities. It's essential to find candidates who are open to change and willing to embrace new challenges.

### Contributions as a Portfolio

Now, let's talk about the real MVPs – candidates who come with tangible contributions. It's like having a buffet of options to choose from. These contributions are like the secret sauce that adds flavor to your project or organization. They demonstrate a candidate's ability to work effectively and make a meaningful impact. It's like having a chef who brings their own unique recipe to the table – a recipe for success.

### The Benefits of Demonstrated Compatibility

When I meet someone who has made an initial attempt at contributing, it's like finding a hidden treasure. It's an implicit proof of compatibility between my project and the person, like two puzzle pieces that fit perfectly together. We can dive into the nitty-gritty details and have more meaningful discussions. These candidates tend to ask insightful questions, showing a better understanding of the project and a genuine interest in its future.

### Multiple Ways of Demonstrating Compatibility

To encourage contributions, various approaches can be taken. Open-source contributions allow candidates to showcase their skills and compatibility. Technical tests, whether paid or not, can also provide valuable insights. It's important to tailor these tests to closely resemble the actual work the candidate would be doing if hired.

### The Power of Portfolios

Portfolios, both professional and personal, offer valuable insights into a candidate's style and capabilities. They provide a glimpse into their work and allow for a better understanding of their skills and experience. It's important to consider both types of portfolios, as they can provide a well-rounded view of a candidate's abilities.

## Embracing Compatibility for Success

In conclusion, when evaluating candidates, it's crucial to look beyond the traditional resume and consider their contributions. Tangible contributions provide evidence of compatibility and demonstrate a candidate's ability to make a meaningful impact. By emphasizing contributions and considering both professional and personal portfolios, we can find the perfect fit and create successful collaborations.

Remember, actions speak louder than words when it comes to compatibility.
