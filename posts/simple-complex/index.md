I often find myself entrenched in complexity.
Complex software designs, complex business models, and complex technical tasks.
It's easy for complexity to sneak into every aspect our lives, especially when dealing with technology.

However, it's important, now more than ever, that we recognize the value of simplicity.
Not just in our lives, but in our code as well.
I've been mulling over this concept quite a bit, and I even shared a tweet recently that succinctly packs my thoughts on this matter:

> "Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated." - Confucius

Embracing simplicity requires courage.
The courage to remove unnecessary components, to streamline our designs, and to ruthlessly prioritize only what adds value.

So, here's a shout-out to all developers, entrepreneurs, and visionaries out there.
It might seem appealing to build complex things to feel clever or accomplished.
But remember, the true genius lies not in creating complexity but in creating simplicity out of the complexity.
Simplicity, I believe, can indeed move mountains.

> "Simplicity is often harder than complexity. You must work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains." - Steve Jobs

So, in your next design meeting or sprint planning, take a moment to question...
Is there a way to make it simpler?

It is better to keep things simple and clear, both in life and work.
When in doubt, go the way of simplicity.
It may seem trickier in the beginning but it will pay off indeed.
The beauty, after all, resides in simplicity.
So, let's aim to create value, not complexity.
