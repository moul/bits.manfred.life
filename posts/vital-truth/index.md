Truth is vital. It forms the foundation of trust, fosters transparency, and promotes freedom of speech. Without truth, our society would crumble into a heap of misinformation, deceit, and confusion. But what exactly is truth? How is it composed? And why is it so important?

## The Composition of Truth

Truth is composed of three key elements: receiving truth, trusting truth, and giving truth. Each of these elements plays a crucial role in the formation and dissemination of truth.

### Receiving Truth

Receiving truth is about having access to accurate and reliable information. It's about being able to discern fact from fiction and make informed decisions based on the truth.
